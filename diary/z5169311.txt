Week 1

I was absent during week 1, but was aware to form group of 5 and was briefd what we will do. 
I participated in the brainstorming online as I wasn't able to attend physically.

Week 2
Decided to choose the waiter app. We had a meeting to discuss the requirements and the user stories. I had to add the stories into Jira.
We also discussed the architecture of the software (database, api, frameworks, etc). 
I was given the backend part of the software, mainly REST APIs. Started to impement very basic order

Week 3

Worked on the proposal as each member was assigned different parts. 
I was in charge of the software architecture with Ganang.
Made the order REST API endpoints. 
Schema changes means that I needed to change bits of the API


Week 4
Completed the order APIs. Moved on to the status of the order. 
Fixed the schema so it fits more on the document base MongoDB.
Instead of having references to another collection, we embed it all in one document so it's easier to fetch.
