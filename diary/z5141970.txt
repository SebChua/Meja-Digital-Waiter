Week 1

The group is formed on week 1. I set up the Jira and Github and also linked them together. Together in week 1 we started brainstorming the main ideas for the project.

Week 2
We finalized the ideas and turned them into stories. We also started our first sprint and started delegating work to members.
I was given the task to create the frontend of the application.
Ive also encountered difficulties mainly in the CSS and also 
blocked because the REST API is not set up yet

Week 3
Week 3 started working on the frontend on the Menu and Recommendation page
and almost finished but there are some changes to the schema 
causing me having to redo the frontend to both the client and admin-client

Week 4
Week 4 I managed to complete all the tickets that was carried over from last sprint
due to the blockage, now I am starting to work on the frontend side of the
reservation
